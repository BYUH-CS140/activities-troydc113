            <p>Welcome to FragranceFan!</p>
            <p>My name is Troy De la Cruz, and I made this website in hopes of helping people get into the perfume and fragrance community. I believe that all fragrance has a story to tell.
                1 Million Royal Rabanne was my very first fragrance. I wanted to impress my girlfriend at the time so I asked her to come with me to Sephora. We didn't know much about fragrances at the time, so it was basically blind leading the blind.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>But your journey doesn't have to be the same as mine. This website offers a curated collection of fragrances, complete with detailed information, my personal reviews, and links to forums for additional insights. Please note that I only feature fragrances I've personally experienced. To suggest a fragrance for me to try, feel free to send a message below!</p>
