            <h3>Personal thoughts:</h3>
            <p>Hands down my favorite one from the line! What a great combination of notes we have right here, the tangerine comes out slightly sweet and fresh and then you got the cardamom which gives it a slight creamy vibe to it! The Lavender and Sage play out so good here as well, especially combined with the patchouli who gives this fragrance a very nice spice and freshness which makes it pretty versatile also! I would say it shines the most on a date night, or while walking in the town with your lady/friends in the colder weather! Overall, a fantastic fragrance that receives a solid score of 8.6 from me! The longevity is quite nice also, I get 7 to 10 hours on my skin from wearing this and the sillage is decent.</p>
