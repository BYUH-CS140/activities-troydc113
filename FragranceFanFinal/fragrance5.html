            <p>for men</p>

            <br>
            <p>Tobacco Collection Rich Warm Addictive 2021 by Zara is an Oriental Vanilla fragrance for men. Tobacco Collection Rich Warm Addictive 2021 was launched in 2021. Top note is Rum; middle note is Peony; base note is Bourbon Vanilla.</p>

            <h3>Personal thoughts:</h3>
            <p>My bottle purchased late 2024 in Australia smells VERY close to Armani Stronger With You Absolutely, but not a clone. It is even richer, darker, and boozier by a little bit. But it does have a very-slight feminine lean which I can't put my finger on --like an upper-class middle-aged woman feminine lean-- while being very dark and boozy. Nonetheless, I think this is unisex and definitely suits guys too. Either dress dark and ominously or like a CEO while wearing this, otherwise this fragrance will wear you. This is a really good fragrance if you like very rich and boozy scents. Man, this is good.</p>
            <p>Smells like a vanilla dessert covered in tobacco smoke</p>
